# claude-code-keepalive

Maximize your Claude usage! `claude-code-keepalive` automatically refreshes your session, guaranteeing you maximize every 5-hour usage window.

## ü§î Why claude-code-keepalive?

Claude provides allocation for exactly 5 hours from the first message you send. All messages sent within this 5-hour window are included in the same session and are not counted as separate sessions. After 5 hours, you need to manually send a message to start a new session and access refreshed tokens.

This is a smart automation tool that perfectly aligns Claude's 5-hour sessions with your usage patterns.

### ‚ùå Problem Scenario
- 9:00 AM: Work starts (session begins)
- 12:00 PM: All usage quota exhausted
- 2:00 PM: Wait until token reset, then resume session
